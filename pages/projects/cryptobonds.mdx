# Crypto Bonds

CryptoBonds is a blockchain application that was built using Hyperledger Sawtooth. The goal of the project is to make a stable coin with its value linked to real life company bonds. CryptoBonds acts as a clearing firm and monitors transactions between the banks and the traders. Traders are able to exchange cryptobonds and other cryptocurrencies with other users.

Our interface can act as trading, bond issuing, and clearing firm to issue bonds. It is built using Hyperledger Sawtooth. We had a lot of help from the mentors and used as many resources as we could. We learned a lot about blockchain and how to create an application around the idea.
