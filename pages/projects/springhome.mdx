# Spring Home

Just a slightly below average HTML5 platformer. Yes, the hitboxes are too big, it's not a bug its a feature.

This game was made for the [2019 Gloabl Game Jam](https://globalgamejam.org/users/jonathansegal). We used [Phaser.io](http://phaser.io/) which is a HTML5 game engine to make a simple platformer.
