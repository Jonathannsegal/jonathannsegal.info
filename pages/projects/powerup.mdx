# Power Up

The first game that I published! This was made in 2013 and released on the [Ouya](https://web.archive.org/web/20150429230523/https://www.ouya.tv/game/Power-UP/). It's a multiplayer dual stick shooter.

Made with Unity3D, this game was my first released app. I was excited for the release of the OUYA and wanted to make a game for the system. Although simple, this game was really fun and rewarding to make.
