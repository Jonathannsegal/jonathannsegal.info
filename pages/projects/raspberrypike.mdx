# Raspberry Pike

Our project was to gamify exercise by using the time one was on a bike as currency to redeem as time spent on the internet.

The goal of the project was create a correlation between physical work and virtual data flow. With this idea in mind we brainstormed a simple pedal bike connected to a stationary trainer. This trainer would have a IR sensor that would read revolution per second. The sensor connects into a micro controller that has a WiFi adapter to broadcast a WiFi signal that the demo computer would pickup. The micro controller would then throttle bandwidth if the physical work dropped below the set timed threshold
