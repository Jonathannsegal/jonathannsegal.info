For our project, we wanted to create an original, plug-and-play game that anyone could use with a laptop and internet access. We created a website that includes colorful navigation and a few different game modes, including our own version of motion tracking pong! To motion track, we used a javascript library that was incredibly quick, refreshing at 200 times per second, and used a machine vision API. The rest of the pages and animations were done in HTML, CSS, and Javascript, with some JQuery implementation. Our website is stored in the cloud service Google Cloud, both so that it wouldn't be running on a localhost, meaning we could turn our laptop off and still have a website up, but it also meant we could manage faster interactions between the user and the interface.
