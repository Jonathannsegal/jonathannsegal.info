I went to go pick up ben halfway between cedar rapids and Chicago and we drove
all the way to des Moines to Ellissa house and stayed there for the night. Caleb

### Vr Tank Game

Jonathan

> I worked on integrating the Oculus Rift Headset and the Leap motion. I built the
> Vehicle and got everything set up. I also ate donuts.

Caleb

> I worked on the environment layout of the game within Unity including the
> structures, colors, and overall design. I made a domain name, and I also drank
> lots of caffeine.

Ben

> I worked on all of the game logic. This meant i made the vehicle move in the way
> we determined, made the tank able to fire bullets, and made the bullets interact
> with the environment. I also helped debug and connect the VR integration.

Ellissa

> did not write on devpost
