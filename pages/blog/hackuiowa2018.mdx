### HackUIowa 2018

My first hackathon! At the beginning of the school year, I decided to sign up
for as many hackathons as I could. The first one on my list to go to was this
one so that Friday night I got in my car and started the 2-hour drive to the
University of Iowa. I read about these events but being my first time I really
had no idea what to expect. I stayed at my parent’s house that Friday night
close to Iowa City and went to the university first thing Saturday morning for
the start of the event at 8:45 am.

After I checked in I went to go look for a team to work with. Surprisingly there
were quite a few people from Iowa State at the event. I found a team from Iowa
State and after the opening ceremony, we got to work.

My teammates Kyle and Ryan already had an idea of what to make. Our project was
to gamify exercise by using the time one was on a bike as currency to redeem as
time spent on the internet. To accomplish what we were trying to make my
teammates added a revolution sensor to the motor of a bike and hooked it up to a
Raspberry Pi and created a program in Python to do computations. I created the
UI using JQuery and a few Javascript libraries.

<span className="figcaption_hack">We only used 3 of the wires</span>

We created a GitHub repository and all started on our own contributions. I first
started trying to create a site using React and found that learning something
entirely new in just a few hours is not the best use of time at a Hackathon. I
started over using what I was familiar with plain Javascript/Html/CSS with
Jquery to make a responsive site. The purpose of this site was to display the
information received from the Python server and display this on the screen
attached to the bike. I found the library [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/)
and used it as a way to animate and render the responsive graphs for the UI, and
[Anime.js](https://animejs.com/) to animate everything else.

  There was a lot going on at the same time
</span>

Towards the end of the first day, we both got out parts mostly working. The
website worked with sample data and the bike produced a working output of
rotation data. The next step was to get the two parts talking to each other. Our
server was running using [Flask ](http://flask.pocoo.org/)and we needed to get
the Python back-end and the Javascript front-end connected using AJAX. We all
left that night and I went back to my parent’s house that night and instead of
sleeping, I continued working on the project.

<span className="figcaption_hack">Selfie with my team</span>

Eventually, I figured out our problem. We were doing a few things wrong such as
file structure and the naming schemes so what I did was create a new project
that was the simplest possible way to have everything working. I created a
Repository with the code used for this. [Simple Flask jQuery
integration](https://github.com/Jonathannsegal/Simple_Flask_jQuery_integration)

<span className="figcaption_hack">Iowa had plenty of food and coffee</span>

When we got back the next morning we laid out a plan of what we needed to get
done before 1 pm when hacking ended. We were almost done with our project we
just needed to integrate what I built over the night into our project and put
the finishing touches on our project.

Everything was connected and working except for one part of the project. The
computation for the data was not working on the python script. We ended up
feeding random data to the front end and displaying a console log of the
rotation directly from the python script.

<span className="figcaption_hack">The Rasberry PI all hooked up</span>

We ended up submitting our project on
[hackerearth](https://hackuiowa.hackerearth.com/sprints/hackuiowa-1/dashboard/da9328c/submission/)
without it fully functioning. We called our project Rasberry Pike

#### Raspberry Pike

> The goal of the project was create a correlation between physical work and
> virtual data flow. With this idea in mind we brainstormed a simple pedal bike
> connected to a stationary trainer. This trainer would have a IR sensor that
> would read revolution per second. The sensor connects into a micro controller
> that has a WiFi adapter to broadcast a WiFi signal that the demo computer would
> pickup. The micro controller would then throttle bandwidth if the physical work
> dropped below the set timed threshold

The judges came around and we demoed what we had and explained how our project
could be used to incentivize exercise and increase physical activity when using
a computer.

<span className="figcaption_hack">The event was packed</span>

This event was an incredible learning experience for me. Building a working
product in a limited amount of time is a great way to learn how to rapidly come
up with ideas and develop fixes for unforeseen problems.

  Checking out other peoples project is a great way to meet others and see new
  ideas
</span>

Going into this I had no idea what to expect but after the event, I know how
hackathons work. There are a few different objectives one could have when
attending one of these events.

1.  Obviously winning a prise is a great goal for a team. If you are trying to win
    something though going into the event you should have a solid idea of what
    you're making. Prizes are sponsored by different companies and each prize has a
    different objective and to win you need to incorporate the objective into your
    project.
1.  Another objective is to network and find people that have similar interests as
    you and to have people that you could potentially work on projects with in the
    future. Also, companies are great to talk to and find places to potentially have
    a Job/ Internship and show employers what skills you are good at and to see what
    you can improve on.
1.  Lastly, you can go just to make something cool with friends, experiment with new
    technologies and get a whole lot of free stuff.

Obviously, you can do all of these things at a hackathon but knowing what you
want to accomplish is a great way to set expectations and to know if you had a
successful event. This was a great first experience for me at a hackathon but it
defiantly won't be my last!
