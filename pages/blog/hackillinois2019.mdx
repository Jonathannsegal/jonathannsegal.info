### Hack Illinois 2019

When a friend told me about this cool hackathon that was over at UIUC I
immediately signed up and got ready for the 5 and a half-hour drive over to
Illinois. This hackathon was going to be a little different than the ones I have
done before, first off its not an MLH hackathon it is just put on by UIUC and
its sponsors and this was going to be focused on open-source technologies where
we partner with mentors as a team and either build something new using open
source technologies or contribute to an existing project.

I made the 6-hour drive down to UIUC and When I got there I made my way over to
the [Digital Computer
Lab](https://map.illinois.edu/view?skinId=0&ACTION=MAP&buildingId=210) to get
checked in. When I got in there was a ton of people all getting checked in and I
waited in line and after I got checked in I got my t-shirt and also a whole
duffle bag full of swag from HackIllinois and the companies sponsoring the
events. This was already a sweet hackathon.

</span>

After getting checked in I made my way over to the Company Expo that was going
on in the building over because I wanted to check that out. In the Lobby of the
Siebel building, there were quite a few tables set up for the different
companies that we're sponsoring the event. I looked through my backpack for
copies of my resume and thankfully I still had a few from the Career fair a few
weeks earlier. Once I got everything together I went to talk to a few of the
company representatives. I ended up talking with Google and Facebook mainly as
well as a few other smaller companies.

After I talked to the companies that I wanted to talk to I decided that I needed
to find a team to work with on the project over the weekend. First I posted
about wanting a team on the Slack that was set up for the event but then I just
went over and started talking with some people. I found some cool guys to walk
around with and they showed me around the Computer Science Quad after we walked
around it was time for dinner. We all went back into the Siebel building for
food. During dinner, my new friends told me that they weren't all that serious
about working on a project and that I should probably go find some others that
were more committed to working on something. One of the guys in the group was
serious though so he and I went out to find a few others.

We ended up finding one other Guy, Ben, so it was me, Philip and Ben, that went
to the opening ceremony the Kenny Gym Annex that was just a few buildings over
from where we were.

<span className="figcaption_hack">

</span>

Once we got to the gym we found seats and waited for the ceremony to start. The
presentation was pretty typical as far as they go they went over the rules and
what would be happening and how to go about starting a project. They talked
about how this hackathon was an open-source hackathon and because of that after
the ceremony we were going to have a chance to go with our teams to see what the
mentors projects were in the open-source community and if they wanted to help us
with there project or we wanted to help them with there’s and we would then team
up and work on something with someone actually working full time in the
open-source community.

One of the developed credited on making the jailbreak on iPhones possible also
talked at the ceremony [Jay Freeman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Freeman)
the man who made Cydia.

After the ceremony, we went over to the mentor room and on the way there Ben was
telling me and Philip about his project that he worked on for the Biz Hackathon,
where you come up with a company idea in 48 hours, and how he got second place.
His idea was to create a stable coin using Blockchain and facilitate it through
a clearinghouse. The idea sounded pretty confusing but super cool and we then
started looking for mentors that have worked with blockchain. We found the
company [HyperLedger](https://www.hyperledger.org/) and talked to the mentors
from there company. The two guys from HyperLedger were interested in our idea
and told us to come to the room that they were going to be in after the session.

<span className="figcaption_hack">Find a mentor</span>

After successfully finding a mentor and coming up with an idea of what we were
going to be working on we went over to the room where the guys from HyperLedger
were and got our stuff set up, this is where we were going to be for pretty much
the entire weekend.

There were a few others in the room and we asked if anyone wanted to join us on
our project after explaining our idea. We had one person join us, Sean, the
others wanted to work on a premade project that HyperLedger had prepared. Zac
Deventhal one of the mentors from Hyperledger gave us a talk on how blockchain
works and why it is used. He walked through the example [Pirate
Talk](https://github.com/delventhalz/pirate-talk) that he made which was a
simple example of using Sawtooth the framework for blockchain that his company
developed.

After the talk we had another person join the team Ali who responded to my
request on the HackIllinois Slack that I made when I first got there. Ben then
gave us all the rundown of actually what we were about to make and tried to
clarify our understanding of the topic.

#### Project Overview

> The goal of the project is to make a stable coin by tying together digital
> currency with real-life company bonds. A bond issued by a company gets reviewed
> by a bank and later goes into the open market where traders are able to buy and
> trade them in exchange for money. CryptoBonds acts as a clearing firm in this
> whole process and provides an interface for companies, banks, and traders to
> interact with each other. Once the ownership is established, a bond goes to
> blockchain network in the form of a transaction. Traders are able to exchange
> crypto bonds and other cryptocurrencies with other users while on the
> blockchain.

<span className="figcaption_hack">Hyperledger</span>

In our project, we were building a platform for Banks, Companies, and Traders,
and our role would be the clearinghouse that authorizes changes in the system.
According to Wikipedia, a [clearinghouse
](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clearing_house_(finance)>)is:

> A **clearing house** is a financial institution formed to facilitate the
> exchange (i.e., [clearance](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clearing_(finance)>))
> of payments, securities, or derivatives transactions. The clearing house stands
> between two clearing firms (also known as member firms or participants). Its
> purpose is to reduce the risk of a member firm failing to honor its trade
> settlement obligations.

This is what we were going to be making. This is necessary for us to create a
stable coin using bonds because we needed to do something called [Atomic
Swapping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency#Atomic_swaps) which is
when one currency is converted to another:

> Atomic swaps are a mechanism where one cryptocurrency can be exchanged directly
> for another cryptocurrency, without the need for a trusted third party such as
> an exchange.

Our system was going to consist of two different parts the Web components and
the Blockchain. The web API was built-in python and using flask we were able to
build out the interface. The Blockchain was built using HyperLedger Sawtooth and
we worked on that in Python primarily. The Blockchain was built to run in a
docker container and interact with the API. Eventually, we were going to have
everything hosted on [Heroku
](https://crypto-bonds.herokuapp.com/cryptoserver/)once everything was working
locally.

To clarify to the team how our app was going to operate I drew out all the
different functions that we wanted to build into the system.

After we all had a better understanding of what we were going to make we took a
quick break to grab donuts!

<span className="figcaption_hack">Donuts!</span>

After the snack, we got back to work on the project for the rest of the night.
The mentors were an incredible help giving us insights on the tools that we were
using and best practices for what we were working on.

The end result of what we were building was creating a stable coin that
companies could make and traders could invest in that was backed by US-based
bonds so that the value of the currency would be less volatile than current
cryptocurrencies on the market today. Wikipedia defines [stable
coin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stablecoin) as:

> **Stablecoins** are
> [cryptocurrencies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency) designed to
> minimize the volatility of the price of the stablecoin, relative to some
> “stable” asset or basket of assets. A stablecoin can be
> [pegged](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed_exchange-rate_system) to a
> [cryptocurrency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency), [fiat
> money](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiat_money), or to [exchange-traded
> commodities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchange-traded_product) (such as
> [precious metals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precious_metal)or industrial
> metals). Stablecoins redeemable in currency, commodities, or fiat money are said
> to be backed, whereas those tied to an algorithm are referred to as
> seignorage-style (not
> backed).[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stablecoin#cite_note-:1-1)

<span className="figcaption_hack">A lot of work was being done.</span>

After a while, it was time for lunch so we all took a break and went down to
grab something to eat.

<span className="figcaption_hack">Lunch</span>

On the way back up we stopped and talked to some of the other companies that
were at the event. There were a lot of booths throughout the event areas with
companies talking about job opportunities and giving away swag.

Also a little later they were giving away Boba tea, it was pretty good.

<span className="figcaption_hack">Boba Tea</span>

The team decided that we did want to go to one of the talks because we made a
decent amount of progress on our project so that we didn't feel bad about
pausing work. We went to Bruce Perens talk about “Open Source in Space” which
was really cool.

<span className="figcaption_hack">Nasa Presentation</span>

After the talk, we got back to work and put the finishing touches on our project
and tried desperately to get the blockchain actually connected to the Web App.
We didn’t end up getting that working but the UI was deployed on Heroku
successfully and the blockchain was working just not receiving input from the
UI.

<span className="figcaption_hack">Hard at work</span>

After a ton of work, we finally presented a project that we were all really
proud of. We had everything up and running and walking through the concepts and
demos flawlessly. It was really fun to show everyone what we had worked on over
the weekend.

<span className="figcaption_hack">The team with the guys from Capital One</span>

The main prize that we were going for was the one presented by Capitol One
because it was the main prize category focused on finance. They liked our
project and got a picture with us after judging

The weekend was great we all had a fun time and learned a lot along the way

<span className="figcaption_hack">The closing Ceremony</span>

Unfortunately, we didn't win anything but from what I heard we were the second
choice for the Capitol One prize. During the closing ceremony, all of the teams
that won something demoed their project and it was cool to see what everyone had
worked on. Although we didn’t win it was still a great time and we worked on
something very technically interesting. Working with Blockchain, Docker, Flask,
etc really was challenging and rewarding. Getting everything working right
before we had to demo and presenting what we had done was really cool. This
project was really fun to work on and I made some great friends over in
Illinois.

The team at Hack Illinois made this cool recap video of the event you should
check out.

### What’s next for Crypto Bonds

We started to continue development but overall that only lasted for a few weeks.
We currently have the project on Github and ready with issues so that either we
or others in the Open-Source community can continue working on it. Bringing this
concept to market could prove to be successful but actually getting companies to
use the project and getting proper licensing to operate is such a high barrier
to entry that at this point we are no longer working on the project. Who knows
we might one day come back to it.
