### HackISU 2018

Iowa State’s 10th annual hackathon. I learned a lot from my first hackathon and
this time I made sure that I was more prepared and utilized what I had learned.
First off I found some friends for a team ahead of time. I organized a meeting
with my two teammates Ben and Nate the Wednesday before the event where we
looked through all the prize categories and discussed what we were going to
make. We wanted to win… anything so when we were going through the list prize
categories we wanted to make a project that hit as many of the categories as
possible. We ended up deciding on a machine vision platform that tracked a
person and allowed them to interact with elements in the scene. Before the
event, I went to Best Buy to get a webcam for our project and one of my
teammates let us borrow his TV. Having an idea of what you are doing ahead of
time is very helpful so you can get parts that you need.

The day of the event finally came and after className that Friday I got one of my
teammates and went to the event the other had some work to do and was coming
later. The hackathon was hosted at the Vermeer Applied Technology Hub located a
few miles from campus. When we got there the place was packed. Everyone was
bringing boxes full to TV’s, computers, extra cables, and everything you could
imagine someone bringing to an event like this. We got there early because we
wanted to get a good table, after signing in we found a table by the wall that
we liked and started setting up. After getting our stuff situated we made our
way around the room to the different tables for the sponsors. Hackathons are a
great way to talk to employers from the industry as they attend these events and
are looking to talk to students about potential carrier opportunities. These
companies also usually have a bunch of free stuff such as t-shirts and stickers!

After making the rounds to the different companies and the opening ceremony we
created a GitHub repo and got to work. First, we figured out what we needed to
accomplish for the project to work. We needed to have a physics engine, a face
tracking system, and a server set up to host our website. We used[
HTML5BoilerPlate](https://html5boilerplate.com/) to make a template for our
project and decided to make everything in Javascript because that was what we
were all most comfortable using. My job was to set up the face tracking system.
I searched online and found a few libraries that looked promising
[tracking.js](https://trackingjs.com/) was what I tried first… more on that
later. Ben was working on integrating the physics, he found a lightweight but
powerful physics engine [matter.js](http://brm.io/matter-js/), and Nate was
looking into how we could host our site on Google Cloud.

<span className="figcaption_hack">Nate and Ben competing at our game</span>

I started looking at the demos for the tracking framework and tried implementing
it into a webpage I made. My problem was that because the engine rendered the
webcam image on an HTML canvas the sizing was not responsive. The tracking
engine I was using was just not working the way I wanted it to so I went looking
to see if there was anything else out there that I could use. I found a
different tracking engine called [pico.js](https://tkv.io/posts/picojs-intro/)
this worked great. The face detection was very fast and had easy to read code to
better integrate with our system. We were still having a problem with the
resolution though so I decided to hardcode the resolution to the size of the TV
that we were using and that mostly fixed the problem.

<span className="figcaption_hack">Me testing the image recognition</span>

Eventually, towards the end of the first night, I got the facial recognition
working and Ben got the physics working now the next step was to integrate the
physics with the face tracking. We worked on this for a while but it was getting
late and my teammates thought we should go to sleep but I wanted to keep
working. I took them back to the dorms and came back to work. It was a long
night but I eventually got the physics working with the face tracking. We had a
physics object stuck to the circle that the facial tracking drew and the object
would follow the player whenever the tracking updated which was up to 200 times
a second.

</span>

That night was a success! I got the entire project functioning the way that we
intended now we just needed to get the gamification implemented to show off what
we did. That morning after my teammates came back we discussed what more we
needed to finish. We decided to implement 4 game modes; one with objects
continually falling and the player could move them with their head; another
where you were timed to get as many off as possible; another where you had to
get 10 off as fast as possible; and lastly a version of pong where each player
controlled a paddle and moved it using their head.

At this point, we tried to deploy our project on Google Cloud but were having
problems when we tried to re-upload our repository. It was stuck to the first
files that we uploaded and didn't update. Nate ended up calling Google and after
an hour on the phone, we ended up giving up on google cloud and decided to host
our project on GitHub pages. At this point, we also decided to sign up for a
domain name for our project to be entered into the best domain name prize. We
found a few names that were not taken and we got two of them. notakinect.com and
[letsuseyourhead.com](https://letsuseyourhead.com/). Nate then started working
on the non-game related elements such as the menu, game over and winning pages
as Ben and I continued working on the main mechanics.

<span className="figcaption_hack">Donuts for breakfast!</span>

As things were coming together we started having problems with merging things in
GitHub. A few times we needed to entirely delete the project from our computers
and try to fix it. We were all working on the master branch and not merging
properly so we were running into issues when we were pushing our commits.
Eventually, we worked out our issues and finished 3 of the 4 game modes. The
last implementation was the hardest because of adding multiple players. We
created two physics elements and only tracked each one on their own side of the
screen and locked their x-axis so they were only able to move up and down.

The project was now fully functional and ready for finishing touches. We thought
that publishing the winners score to twitter would be a fun thing to implement
plus it was a price category. [@NKinect](https://twitter.com/NKinect) was the
account we made and integrated into our project. When you won in the Face Pong
mode it would send out a tweet saying that you won.

At this point, our project was ready for submission we created the [DevPost
](https://devpost.com/software/hungryhungryhacker)page and added all of the
categories we were able to integrate into our project. Machine Vision was the
strongest point of our project, it was also very interactive big and fun to
play. Below is our DevPost listing.

#### hungryhungryhacker

> For our project, we wanted to create an original, plug-and-play game that anyone
> could use with a laptop and internet access. We created a website that includes
> colorful navigation and a few different game modes, including our own version of
> motion tracking pong! To motion track, we used a javascript library that was
> incredibly quick, refreshing at 200 times per second, and used a **machine
> vision API**. The rest of the pages and animations were done in HTML, CSS, and
> Javascript, with some **JQuery**implementation. Our website is stored in the
> cloud service **Google Cloud**, both so that it wouldn’t be running on a
> localhost, meaning we could turn our laptop off and still have a website up, but
> it also meant we could manage faster interactions between the user and the
> interface.

Jonathan

> I implemented the machine vision API through java script. I also helped create
> an environment that led to the best use of my teams time and the best ideas. I
> helped integrate the physics engine with the face tracking API as well.

Nate

> I worked on the domain in domain.com and cloud integration on Google Cloud for
> our website, as well as working on the main navigation pages in CSS and HTML.

Ben

> I worked on implementing the physics engine for each game mode along with the
> logic of each game mode. This includes deciding the rate at which the objects
> fall, the logic for collisions between objects, deleting and creating new
> objects when appropriate, and more.

  We did have a lot of fun playing our game
</span>

That night they also ordered way too much pizza which was the best! We each got
our own pizza for dinner… way too much pizza and caffeine were consumed. That
after we submitted our project we went around and looked at what everyone else
was making, there were some incredible projects that were made, from a robot
that shoots a nerf gun to a procedurally generated co-op horror game using an
oculus rift, there were a lot of cool projects. My team decided to get some
sleep that night so we could be rested for the judging tomorrow.

Next morning… the alarm goes off… snooze… we wake up late and rush from the dorm
over to the event and frenetically set up our table and go over to the students
running the event and try to get judges to come over to our table. The judges
eventually come over and everything is fine but arriving late was definitely not
great. After the judging is over we all go over to the stage for the prizes and
find out WE WON!

  Nate had to work but Ben and I Proudly got up and accepted our award
</span>

We won best domain name, not a technical award but an award nonetheless. Overall
this hackathon was great I learned a lot met some new people and even got an
interview for a job.

During the judging, the recruiters from [Corteva](https://www.corteva.com/) came
over and asked about our project we demoed and talked through our process and
how we developed it. They gave us application forms and told us to keep in touch
with them. I never actually filled out the form but one of the recruiters from
the event later contacted me on LinkedIn and we set up an interview and this
summer I’ll be in Des Moines, IA working at Corteva!

---

This hackathon I was much more prepared than the first one and my team did a lot
right but there is also a lot of room for improvement. First off don’t be late
for judging. We were not the smartest being late but we were lucky and it worked
out for us, next time we will wake up much earlier and set more alarms. Another
thing that we did was try to implement everything we could instead of working
with a limited amount of technologies that we could easily implement into one
strong candidate for one prize category. Overall I learned a lot and I can't
wait for my next Hackathon!
